//Rock paper scissors
//
//the game will play against the computer. Begin with a function
//called getComputerChoice that returns 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'
//
//write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors
//it should take two parameters- the playerSelection and computerSelection
//then return a string that declares the winner: "You lose! paper beats rock"
//- Make the playerSelection parameter case-insensitive so user can input
//rock, ROCK, RocK
//
//note: you want to return the results of this function call not console.log() 
//them. You're going to use what you return later on
//
//Write a new function called game(). use the previous function inside
//of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports winner or loser
//at the end.
